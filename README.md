💡 Requirements

* Python 3.10 or 3.9 (MediaPipe doesn't support 3.11+ well)
* Webcam
* Good lighting for hand visibility

🧠 How It Works

* Uses MediaPipe’s hand landmark model to track finger positions in real-time.
* Maps index finger coordinates to your screen resolution.
* Detects specific gesture combinations to trigger:

  * Mouse movement
  * Left/right clicks
  * Scrolling
  * Exit on full-hand open
